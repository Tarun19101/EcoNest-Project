      <p>
        An <strong>eco-home</strong> is a house that’s designed to reduce its environmental impact — from how it’s built to how it operates. It saves energy, uses eco-friendly materials, conserves water, and is often healthier for the people who live in it.
      </p>

      <h3>🌿 Key Features of an Eco-Home:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Solar panels, smart insulation, and natural lighting reduce electricity needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Eco-Friendly Materials:</strong> Bamboo, recycled wood, mud bricks, and low-VOC paints are common.</li>
        <li><strong>Water Conservation:</strong> Rainwater harvesting, greywater reuse, and low-flow fixtures help save water.</li>
        <li><strong>Waste Reduction:</strong> Designs that minimize construction waste and promote composting or recycling.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthy Living:</strong> Better indoor air quality and natural airflow keep the home fresh and toxin-free.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>🏡 How is it Different from a Normal Home?</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike traditional houses, eco-homes are built with sustainability in mind right from the beginning. While standard homes often rely heavily on electricity, artificial cooling/heating, and synthetic materials, eco-homes prioritize <em>natural balance</em> and <em>long-term savings</em>.
      </p>

      <h3>🌏 Eco-Homes & the SDGs</h3>
      <p>
        Building and living in eco-homes supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals — especially:
        <ul>
          <li>Affordable and clean energy</li>
          <li>Sustainable cities and communities</li>
          <li>Responsible consumption and production</li>
          <li>Climate action</li>
        </ul>
